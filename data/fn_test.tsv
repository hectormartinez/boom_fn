Second	_
question	_
:	_
Why	_
did	_
we	_
announce	_
and	_
started	_
fighting	_
the	_
Shiites	_
and	_
police	_
from	_
the	_
start	_
,	_
even	_
though	_
most	_
of	_
the	_
Jihadist	_
sectors	_
and	_
the	_
public	_
did	_
n't	_
understand	_
what	_
we	_
want	_
,	_
and	_
did	_
n't	_
know	_
the	_
importance	_
of	_
starting	_
with	_
those	_
?	_
So	_
what	_
's	_
the	_
objection	_
on	_
killing	_
and	_
executing	_
the	_
Sheiks	_
now	_
and	_
without	_

just	_
like	_
we	_
did	_
by	_
killing	_
the	_
police	_
then	_
?	_
Were	_
people	_
satisfied	_
with	_
us	_
?	_
Actually	_
lot	_
of	_
the	_

thinks	_
that	_
who	_
killed	_
the	_
police	_
is	_
Badr	_

or	_

from	_

And	_
that	_
who	_
's	_
killing	_

hired	_
by	_

the	_

We	_
have	_
no	_

with	_
you	_

for	_
us	_
to	_
give	_
the	_
name	_

130	_

One	_

Sherlock	_
Holmes	_
's	_
defects	_
--	_
if	_
,	_
indeed	_
,	_
one	_
may	_
call	_
it	_
a	_
defect	_
--	_
was	_
that	_
he	_
was	_
exceedingly	_
loath	_
to	_
communicate	_
his	_
full	_
plans	_
to	_
any	_
other	_
person	_
until	_
the	_
instant	_
of	_
their	_
fulfilment	_
.	_
Partly	_
it	_
came	_
no	_
doubt	_
from	_
his	_
own	_
masterful	_
nature	_
,	_
which	_
loved	_
to	_
dominate	_
and	_
surprise	_
those	_
who	_
were	_
around	_
him	_
.	_
Partly	_
also	_
from	_
his	_
professional	_
caution	_
,	_
which	_
urged	_
him	_
never	_
to	_
take	_
any	_
chances	_
.	_
The	_
result	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
was	_
very	_
trying	_
for	_
those	_
who	_
were	_
acting	_
as	_
his	_
agents	_
and	_
assistants	_
.	_
I	_
had	_
often	_
suffered	_
under	_
it	_
,	_
but	_
never	_
more	_
so	_
than	_
during	_
that	_
long	_
drive	_
in	_
the	_
darkness	_
.	_
The	_
great	_
ordeal	_
was	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
;	_
at	_
last	_
we	_
were	_
about	_
to	_
make	_
our	_
final	_
effort	_
,	_
and	_
yet	_
Holmes	_
had	_
said	_
nothing	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
could	_
only	_
surmise	_
what	_
his	_
course	_
of	_
action	_
would	_
be	_
.	_
My	_
nerves	_
thrilled	_
with	_
anticipation	_
when	_
at	_
last	_
the	_
cold	_
wind	_
upon	_
our	_
faces	_
and	_
the	_
dark	_
,	_
void	_
spaces	_
on	_
either	_
side	_
of	_
the	_
narrow	_
road	_
told	_
me	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
back	_
upon	_
the	_
moor	_
once	_
again	_
.	_
Every	_
stride	_
of	_
the	_
horses	_
and	_
every	_
turn	_
of	_
the	_
wheels	_
was	_
taking	_
us	_
nearer	_
to	_
our	_
supreme	_
adventure	_
.	_
Our	_
conversation	_
was	_
hampered	_
by	_
the	_
presence	_
of	_
the	_
driver	_
of	_
the	_
hired	_
wagonette	_
,	_
so	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
forced	_
to	_
talk	_
of	_
trivial	_
matters	_
when	_
our	_
nerves	_
were	_
tense	_
with	_
emotion	_
and	_
anticipation	_
.	_
It	_
was	_
a	_
relief	_
to	_
me	_
,	_
after	_
that	_
unnatural	_
restraint	_
,	_
when	_
we	_
at	_
last	_
passed	_
Frankland	_
's	_
house	_
and	_
knew	_
that	_
we	_
were	_
drawing	_
near	_
to	_
the	_
Hall	_
and	_
to	_
the	_
scene	_
of	_
action	_
.	_
We	_
did	_
not	_
drive	_
up	_
to	_
the	_
door	_
but	_
got	_
down	_
near	_
the	_
gate	_
of	_
the	_
avenue	_
.	_
The	_
wagonette	_
was	_
paid	_
off	_
and	_
ordered	_
to	_
return	_
to	_
Coombe	_
Tracey	_
forthwith	_
,	_
while	_
we	_
started	_
to	_
walk	_

``	_

the	_

with	_

round	_

gloomy	_

along	_
the	_
track	_
as	_
if	_
we	_
were	_
bound	_
for	_
the	_

I	_
tiptoed	_
down	_

stooped	_
behind	_
the	_
low	_
wall	_

surrounded	_

could	_

straight	_
through	_

was	_
talking	Chatting

the	_

looked	Appearance

distrait	_

of	_
that	_

across	_
the	_

hung	_
a	_

fog	_

It	_
was	_
drifting	_
slowly	_
in	_
our	_
direction	_

and	_
banked	_
itself	_
up	_

low	_

The	_

shone	_
on	_

with	_
the	_
heads	_

The	_
night	_
was	_
clear	_
and	_
fine	_
above	_
us	_
.	_
The	_
stars	_
shone	_
cold	_
and	_
bright	_
,	_
while	_
a	_
half	_
-	_
moon	_
bathed	_
the	_
whole	_
scene	_
in	_
a	_
soft	_
,	_
uncertain	_
light	_
.	_
Before	_
us	_
lay	_
the	_
dark	_
bulk	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
,	_
its	_
serrated	_
roof	_
and	_
bristling	_
chimneys	_
hard	_
outlined	_
against	_
the	_
silver	_
-	_
spangled	_
sky	_
.	_
Broad	_
bars	_
of	_
golden	_
light	_
from	_
the	_
lower	_
windows	_
stretched	_
across	_
the	_
orchard	_
and	_
the	_
moor	_
.	_
One	_
of	_
them	_
was	_
suddenly	_
shut	_
off	_
.	_
The	_
servants	_
had	_
left	_
the	_
kitchen	_
.	_
There	_
only	_
remained	_
the	_
lamp	_
in	_
the	_
dining	_
room	_
where	_
the	_
two	_
men	_
,	_
the	_
murderous	_
host	_
and	_
the	_
unconscious	_
guest	_
,	_
still	_
chatted	_
over	_
their	_
cigars	_

Every	_
minute	_
that	_
white	_
woolly	_
plain	_
which	_
covered	_
one	_
half	_
of	_
the	_
moor	_
was	_
drifting	_
closer	_
and	_
closer	_
to	_
the	_
house	_
.	_
Already	_
the	_
first	_
thin	_
wisps	_
of	_
it	_
were	_
curling	_
across	_
the	_
golden	_
square	_
of	_
the	_
lighted	_
window	_
.	_
The	_
farther	_
wall	_
of	_
the	_
orchard	_
was	_
already	_
invisible	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
trees	_
were	_
standing	_
out	_
of	_
a	_
swirl	_
of	_
white	_
vapour	_
.	_
As	_
we	_
watched	_
it	_
the	_
fog	_
-	_
wreaths	_
came	_
crawling	_
round	_
both	_
corners	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
and	_
rolled	_
slowly	_
into	_
one	_
dense	_
bank	_
,	_
on	_
which	_
the	_
upper	_
floor	_
and	_
the	_
roof	_
floated	_
like	_
a	_
strange	_
ship	_
upon	_
a	_
shadowy	_
sea	_

Holmes	_
struck	_
his	_
hand	_
passionately	_
upon	_
the	_
rock	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
and	_
stamped	_
his	_
feet	_
in	_
his	_
impatience	_

``	_

In	_

we	_

``	_

''	_
So	_
as	_
the	_
fog	_
-	_
bank	_
flowed	_
onward	_
we	_
fell	_
back	_
before	_
it	_
until	_
we	_
were	_
half	_
a	_
mile	_
from	_
the	_
house	_

and	_
still	_
that	_
dense	_
white	_
sea	_
,	_
with	_
the	_
moon	_
silvering	_
its	_
upper	_
edge	_

swept	_
slowly	_

inexorably	_
on	_

``	_
We	_
are	_
going	_

Holmes	_

``	_

At	_
all	_
costs	_
we	_
must	_
hold	_
our	_
ground	_
where	_

''	_
He	_
dropped	_
on	_
his	_
knees	_
and	_
clapped	_
his	_
ear	_
to	_
the	_
ground	_

``	_
Thank	_
God	_
,	_
I	_
think	_
that	_
I	_

coming	_

''	_
A	_
sound	_
of	_
quick	_
steps	_
broke	_
the	_
silence	_
of	_
the	_
moor	_
.	_
Crouching	_
among	_
the	_
stones	_
we	_
stared	_
intently	_
at	_
the	_
silver-tipped	_
bank	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
.	_
The	_
steps	_
grew	_
louder	_
,	_
and	_
through	_
the	_
fog	_
,	_
as	_
through	_
a	_
curtain	_
,	_
there	_
stepped	_
the	_
man	_
whom	_
we	_
were	_
awaiting	_
.	_
He	_
looked	_
round	_
him	_
in	_
surprise	_
as	_
he	_
emerged	_
into	_
the	_
clear	_
,	_
starlit	_
night	_
.	_
Then	_
he	_
came	_
swiftly	_
along	_
the	_
path	_
,	_
passed	_
close	_
to	_
where	_
we	_
lay	_
,	_
and	_
went	_
on	_
up	_
the	_
long	_
slope	_
behind	_
us	_
.	_
As	_
he	_
walked	_
he	_
glanced	_
continually	_
over	_
either	_
shoulder	_
,	_
like	_
a	_
man	_
who	_
is	_
ill	_
at	_
ease	_
.	_
``	_
Hist	_
!	_
''	_
cried	_
Holmes	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
heard	_
the	_
sharp	_
click	_
of	_
a	_
cocking	_
pistol	_
.	_
``	_
Look	_
out	_
!	_
It	_
's	_
coming	_
!	_
''	_
There	_
was	_
a	_
thin	_
,	_
crisp	_
,	_
continuous	_
patter	_
from	_
somewhere	_
in	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
that	_
crawling	_
bank	_
.	_
The	_
cloud	_
was	_
within	_
fifty	_
yards	_
of	_
where	_
we	_
lay	_
,	_
and	_
we	_
glared	_
at	_
it	_
,	_
all	_
three	_
,	_
uncertain	_
what	_
horror	_
was	_
about	_
to	_
break	_
from	_
the	_
heart	_
of	_
it	_
.	_
I	_
was	_
at	_
Holmes	_
's	_
elbow	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
glanced	_
for	_
an	_
instant	_
at	_
his	_
face	_
.	_
It	_
was	_
pale	_
and	_
exultant	_
,	_
his	_
eyes	_
shining	_
brightly	_
in	_
the	_
moonlight	_
.	_
But	_
suddenly	_
they	_
started	_
forward	_
in	_
a	_
rigid	_
,	_
fixed	_
stare	_
,	_
and	_
his	_
lips	_
parted	_
in	_
amazement	_
.	_
At	_
the	_
same	_
instant	_
Lestrade	_
gave	_
a	_
yell	_
of	_
terror	_
and	_
threw	_
himself	_
face	_
downward	_
upon	_
the	_
ground	_
.	_
I	_
sprang	_
to	_
my	_
feet	_
,	_
my	_
inert	_
hand	_
grasping	_
my	_
pistol	_
,	_
my	_
mind	_
paralyzed	_
by	_
the	_
dreadful	_
shape	_
which	_
had	_
sprung	_
out	_
upon	_
us	_
from	_
the	_
shadows	_
of	_
the	_
fog	_
.	_
A	_
hound	_
it	_
was	_
,	_
an	_
enormous	_
coal	_
-	_
black	_
hound	_
,	_
but	_
not	_
such	_
a	_
hound	_
as	_
mortal	_
eyes	_
have	_
ever	_
seen	_
.	_
Fire	_
burst	_
from	_
its	_
open	_
mouth	_
,	_
its	_
eyes	_
glowed	_
with	_
a	_
smouldering	_
glare	_
,	_
its	_
muzzle	_
and	_
hackles	_
and	_
dewlap	_
were	_
outlined	_
in	_
flickering	_
flame	_
.	_
Never	_
in	_
the	_
delirious	_
dream	_
of	_
a	_
disordered	_
brain	_
could	_
anything	_
more	_
savage	_
,	_
more	_
appalling	_
,	_
more	_
hellish	_
be	_
conceived	_
than	_
that	_
dark	_
form	_
and	_
savage	_
face	_
which	_
broke	_
upon	_
us	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
wall	_
of	_
fog	_
.	_
With	_
long	_
bounds	_
the	_
huge	_
black	_
creature	_
was	_
leaping	_
down	_
the	_
track	_
,	_
following	_
hard	_
upon	_
the	_
footsteps	_
of	_
our	_
friend	_
.	_
So	_
paralyzed	_
were	_
we	_
by	_
the	_
apparition	_
that	_
we	_
allowed	_
him	_
to	_
pass	_
before	_
we	_
had	_
recovered	_
our	_
nerve	_
.	_
Then	_
Holmes	_
and	_
I	_
both	_
fired	_
together	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
creature	_
gave	_
a	_
hideous	_
howl	_
,	_
which	_
showed	_
that	_
one	_
at	_
least	_
had	_
hit	_
him	_
.	_
He	_
did	_
not	_
pause	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
but	_
bounded	_
onward	_
.	_
Far	_
away	_
on	_
the	_
path	_
we	_
saw	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
looking	_
back	_
,	_
his	_
face	_
white	_
in	_
the	_
moonlight	_
,	_
his	_
hands	_
raised	_
in	_
horror	_
,	_
glaring	_
helplessly	_
at	_
the	_
frightful	_
thing	_
which	_
was	_
hunting	_
him	_
down	_
.	_
But	_
that	_
cry	_
of	_
pain	_
from	_
the	_
hound	_
had	_
blown	_
all	_
our	_
fears	_
to	_
the	_
winds	_
.	_
If	_
he	_
was	_
vulnerable	_
he	_
was	_
mortal	_
,	_
and	_
if	_
we	_
could	_
wound	_
him	_
we	_
could	_
kill	_
him	_
.	_
Never	_
have	_
I	_
seen	_
a	_
man	_
run	_
as	_
Holmes	_
ran	_
that	_
night	_
.	_
I	_
am	_
reckoned	_
fleet	_
of	_
foot	_
,	_
but	_
he	_
outpaced	_
me	_
as	_
much	_
as	_
I	_
outpaced	_
the	_
little	_
professional	_
.	_
In	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
as	_
we	_
flew	_
up	_
the	_
track	_
we	_
heard	_
scream	_
after	_
scream	_
from	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
and	_
the	_
deep	_
roar	_
of	_
the	_
hound	_
.	_
I	_
was	_
in	_
time	_
to	_
see	_
the	_
beast	_
spring	_
upon	_
its	_
victim	_
,	_
hurl	_
him	_
to	_
the	_
ground	_
,	_
and	_
worry	_
at	_
his	_
throat	_
.	_
But	_
the	_
next	_
instant	_
Holmes	_
had	_
emptied	_
five	_
barrels	_
of	_
his	_
revolver	_
into	_
the	_
creature	_
's	_
flank	_
.	_
With	_
a	_
last	_
howl	_
of	_
agony	_
and	_
a	_
vicious	_
snap	_
in	_
the	_
air	_
,	_
it	_
rolled	_
upon	_
its	_
back	_
,	_
four	_
feet	_
pawing	_
furiously	_
,	_
and	_
then	_
fell	_
limp	_
upon	_
its	_
side	_
.	_
I	_
stooped	_
,	_
panting	_
,	_
and	_
pressed	_
my	_
pistol	_
to	_
the	_
dreadful	_
,	_
shimmering	_
head	_
,	_
but	_
it	_
was	_
useless	_
to	_
press	_
the	_
trigger	_
.	_
The	_
giant	_
hound	_
was	_
dead	_
.	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
lay	_
insensible	_
where	_
he	_
had	_
fallen	_
.	_
We	_
tore	_
away	_
his	_
collar	_
,	_
and	_
Holmes	_
breathed	_
a	_
prayer	_
of	_
gratitude	_
when	_
we	_
saw	_
that	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
sign	_
of	_
a	_
wound	_
and	_
that	_
the	_
rescue	_
had	_
been	_
in	_
time	_
.	_
Already	_
our	_
friend	_
's	_
eyelids	_
shivered	_
and	_
he	_
made	_
a	_
feeble	_
effort	_
to	_
move	_
.	_
Lestrade	_
thrust	_
his	_
brandy	_
-	_
flask	_
between	_
the	_
baronet	_
's	_
teeth	_
,	_
and	_
two	_
frightened	_
eyes	_
were	_
looking	_
up	_
at	_
us	_
.	_
``	_
My	_
God	_
!	_
''	_
he	_
whispered	_
.	_
``	_
What	_
was	_
it	_
?	_
What	_

in	_
heaven	_
's	_
name	_

?	_
''	_
``	_
It	_

Holmes	_

``	_
We	_
've	_
laid	_

family	_
ghost	_
once	_
and	_
forever	_

''	_
In	_
mere	_
size	_
and	_
strength	_
it	_
was	_
a	_
terrible	_
creature	_
which	_
was	_
lying	_
stretched	_
before	_
us	_
.	_
It	_
was	_
not	_
a	_
pure	_
bloodhound	_
and	_
it	_
was	_
not	_
a	_
pure	_
mastiff	_

it	_
appeared	_
to	_
be	_
a	_
combination	_
of	_
the	_
two	_

gaunt	_
,	_
savage	_

and	_
as	_
large	_

lioness	_

Even	_
now	_

in	_
the	_
stillness	_
of	_
death	_
,	_
the	_
huge	_
jaws	_
seemed	_
to	_

dripping	_
with	_
a	_
bluish	_
flame	_

the	_
small	_

deep	_

set	_

cruel	_
eyes	_

ringed	_
with	_
fire	_

placed	_
my	_
hand	_
upon	_
the	_
glowing	_
muzzle	_

and	_
as	_
I	_
held	_
them	_
up	_

his	_

he	_
was	_
still	_
ghastly	_

The	_
front	_

was	_
open	_

so	_
we	_
rushed	_
in	_

hurried	_
from	_
room	_

room	_

the	_
amazement	_

a	_
doddering	_
old	_
manservant	_

met	_
us	_

passage	_

There	_
was	_
no	_

in	_
the	_

Holmes	_
caught	_
up	_
the	_
lamp	_
and	_
left	_
no	_
corner	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
unexplored	_

No	_
sign	_
could	_
we	_
see	_
of	_
the	_

we	_
were	_
chasing	_

On	_
the	_
upper	_
floor	_

one	_
of	_
the	_
bedroom	_

was	_
locked	_

``	_

''	_
A	_
faint	_
moaning	_
and	_
rustling	_
came	_
from	_
within	_

Holmes	_
struck	_
the	_
door	_
just	_
over	_
the	_
lock	_
with	_
the	_
flat	_
of	_
his	_
foot	_
and	_
it	_
flew	_
open	_
.	_
Pistol	_
in	_
hand	_
,	_
we	_
all	_
three	_
rushed	_
into	_
the	_
room	_

But	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
sign	_
within	_
it	_
of	_
that	_
desperate	_
and	_
defiant	_
villain	_
whom	_
we	_
expected	_
to	_
see	_
.	_
Instead	_
we	_
were	_
faced	_
by	_
an	_
object	_
so	_
strange	_
and	_
so	_
unexpected	_
that	_
we	_
stood	_
for	_
a	_
moment	_
staring	_
at	_
it	_
in	_
amazement	_
.	_
The	_
room	_
had	_
been	_
fashioned	_
into	_
a	_
small	_
museum	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
walls	_
were	_
lined	_
by	_
a	_
number	_
of	_
glass	_
-	_
topped	_
cases	_
full	_
of	_
that	_
collection	_
of	_
butterflies	_
and	_
moths	_
the	_
formation	_
of	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
the	_
relaxation	_
of	_
this	_
complex	_
and	_
dangerous	_
man	_
.	_
In	_
the	_
centre	_
of	_
this	_
room	_
there	_
was	_
an	_
upright	_
beam	_
,	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
placed	_
at	_
some	_
period	_
as	_
a	_
support	_
for	_
the	_
old	_
worm-eaten	_
baulk	_
of	_
timber	_
which	_
spanned	_
the	_
roof	_
.	_
To	_
this	_
post	_
a	_
figure	_
was	_
tied	_
,	_
so	_
swathed	_
and	_
muffled	_
in	_
the	_
sheets	_
which	_
had	_
been	_
used	_
to	_
secure	_
it	_
that	_
one	_
could	_
not	_
for	_
the	_
moment	_
tell	_
whether	_
it	_
was	_
that	_
of	_
a	_
man	_
or	_
a	_
woman	_
.	_
One	_
towel	_
passed	_
round	_
the	_
throat	_
and	_
was	_
secured	_
at	_
the	_
back	_
of	_
the	_
pillar	_
.	_
Another	_
covered	_
the	_
lower	_
part	_
of	_
the	_
face	_
,	_
and	_
over	_
it	_
two	_
dark	_
eyes	_
--	_
eyes	_
full	_
of	_
grief	_
and	_
shame	_
and	_
a	_
dreadful	_
questioning	_
--	_
stared	_
back	_
at	_
us	_
.	_
In	_
a	_
minute	_
we	_
had	_
torn	_
off	_
the	_
gag	_
,	_
unswathed	_
the	_
bonds	_
,	_
and	_
Mrs	_
.	_
Stapleton	_
sank	_
upon	_
the	_
floor	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
us	_
.	_
As	_
her	_
beautiful	_
head	_
fell	_
upon	_
her	_
chest	_
I	_
saw	_
the	_
clear	_
red	_
weal	_
of	_
a	_
whiplash	_
across	_
her	_
neck	_

``	_

again	_

She	_
shot	_
her	_
arms	_
out	_
from	_
her	_
sleeves	_
,	_
and	_
we	_
saw	_
with	_
horror	_
that	_
they	_
were	_
all	_
mottled	_
with	_
bruises	_

She	_
broke	_
into	_
passionate	_
sobbing	_

she	_
spoke	_

``	_

The	_
fog	_

bank	_
lay	_
like	_
white	_
wool	_
against	_
the	_
window	_

It	_
was	_
evident	_
to	_
us	_
that	_
all	_
pursuit	_
was	_
in	_
vain	_
until	_
the	_
fog	_
had	_
lifted	_

Meanwhile	_
we	_
left	_
Lestrade	_
in	_
possession	_
of	_
the	_
house	_
while	_
Holmes	_
and	_
I	_
went	_
back	_
with	_
the	_
baronet	_
to	_
Baskerville	_
Hall	_

The	_
story	_
of	_
the	_
Stapletons	_
could	_
no	_
longer	_
be	_
withheld	_
from	_
him	_
,	_
but	_
he	_
took	_
the	_
blow	_
bravely	_
when	_
he	_
learned	_
the	_
truth	_
about	_
the	_
woman	_
whom	_
he	_
had	_
loved	_
.	_
But	_
the	_
shock	_
of	_
the	_
night	_
's	_
adventures	_
had	_
shattered	_
his	_
nerves	_
,	_
and	_
before	_
morning	_
he	_
lay	_
delirious	_
in	_
a	_
high	_
fever	_
,	_
under	_
the	_
care	_
of	_
Dr	_
.	_
Mortimer	_
.	_
The	_
two	_
of	_
them	_
were	_
destined	_
to	_
travel	_
together	_
round	_
the	_
world	_
before	_
Sir	_
Henry	_
had	_
become	_
once	_
more	_
the	_
hale	_
,	_
hearty	_
man	_
that	_
he	_
had	_
been	_
before	_
he	_
became	_
master	_
of	_
that	_
ill	_
-	_
omened	_
estate	_
.	_
And	_
now	_
I	_
come	_
rapidly	_
to	_
the	_
conclusion	_
of	_
this	_
singular	_
narrative	_
,	_
in	_
which	_
I	_
have	_
tried	_
to	_
make	_
the	_
reader	_
share	_
those	_
dark	_
fears	_
and	_
vague	_
surmises	_
which	_
clouded	_
our	_
lives	_
so	_
long	_
and	_
ended	_
in	_
so	_
tragic	_
a	_
manner	_
.	_
On	_
the	_
morning	_
after	_
the	_
death	_
of	_
the	_
hound	_
the	_
fog	_
had	_
lifted	_
and	_
we	_
were	_
guided	_
by	_
Mrs	_
.	_
Stapleton	_
to	_
the	_
point	_
where	_
they	_
had	_
found	_
a	_
pathway	_
through	_
the	_
bog	_
.	_
It	_
helped	_
us	_
to	_
realize	_
the	_
horror	_
of	_
this	_
woman	_
's	_
life	_
when	_
we	_
saw	_
the	_
eagerness	_
and	_
joy	_
with	_
which	_
she	_
laid	_
us	_
on	_
her	_
husband	_
's	_
track	_
.	_
We	_
left	_
her	_
standing	_
upon	_
the	_
thin	_
peninsula	_
of	_
firm	_
,	_
peaty	_
soil	_
which	_
tapered	_
out	_
into	_
the	_
widespread	_
bog	_
.	_
From	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
it	_
a	_
small	_
wand	_
planted	_
here	_
and	_
there	_
showed	_
where	_
the	_
path	_
zigzagged	_
from	_
tuft	_
to	_
tuft	_
of	_
rushes	_
among	_
those	_
green-scummed	_
pits	_
and	_
foul	_
quagmires	_
which	_
barred	_
the	_
way	_
to	_
the	_
stranger	_
.	_
Rank	_
reeds	_
and	_
lush	_
,	_
slimy	_
water	_
-	_
plants	_
sent	_
an	_
odour	_
of	_
decay	_
and	_
a	_
heavy	_
miasmatic	_
vapour	_
onto	_
our	_
faces	_
,	_
while	_
a	_
false	_
step	_
plunged	_
us	_
more	_
than	_
once	_
thigh-deep	_
into	_
the	_
dark	_
,	_
quivering	_
mire	_
,	_
which	_
shook	_
for	_
yards	_
in	_
soft	_
undulations	_
around	_
our	_
feet	_
.	_
Its	_
tenacious	_
grip	_
plucked	_
at	_
our	_
heels	_
as	_
we	_
walked	_
,	_
and	_
when	_
we	_
sank	_
into	_
it	_
it	_
was	_
as	_
if	_
some	_
malignant	_
hand	_
was	_
tugging	_
us	_
down	_
into	_
those	_
obscene	_
depths	_
,	_
so	_
grim	_
and	_
purposeful	_
was	_
the	_
clutch	_
